## Objective
- Understand key cybersecurity frameworks and standards
- Identify major cybersecurity laws and regulations
- Learn how frameworks map to regulatory compliance
- Practice applying frameworks to real-world scenarios



## ** Task Outline**

### **1. Research Assignment**


**Frameworks / Standards**

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
* ISO/IEC 27001
* CIS Controls
* PCI DSS
* COBIT
* SOC 2 Trust Principles

**Regulations / Laws**

* GDPR (Europe)
* HIPAA (USA, healthcare)
* CCPA (California)
* Nigerian Data Protection Act (NDPA)
* SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
* Nigerian Cybercrime Act 2015



* A **5-minute presentation** covering:

  * What the framework/regulation is
  * Who must comply
  * Key principles or controls
  * Penalties for non-compliance
  * A real-life example (e.g. a breach fine under GDPR)



### **3. Framework Mapping Activity**

> **Scenario:**
> You’re a cybersecurity consultant for a fintech startup in Nigeria handling sensitive financial and personal data. The company plans to expand into Europe next year.
>
> Your client asks:
>
> * Which **frameworks** should they adopt?
> * Which **regulations** must they comply with?
> * How do these frameworks help them comply with those laws?


* A short write-up recommending:

  * **At least one framework**
  * **At least two regulations** relevant to the scenario
* A simple mapping:

  * e.g. “NIST CSF PR.AC-1 helps meet GDPR Article 32 by requiring access control policies.”


### **4. Quiz**
- Which standard is mandatory for credit card companies?
- What does “CIA triad” stand for?
- GDPR fines can be up to what percentage of annual revenue?
- Which framework is published by NIST? 
- Name one Nigerian cybersecurity law. 


## ** Deliverables**

- Slides for the chosen framework/regulation
- Short report for the scenario mapping
