### Task Outline

#### Part 1: Cybersecurity Fundamentals

1. Write a **one-page summary** explaining what cybersecurity is and why it is important in today’s world.
2. Include **at least three real-life examples** of cybersecurity incidents (e.g., data breaches, ransomware attacks, phishing scams).
3. Identify **one major takeaway** from each example.


#### Part 2: CIA Triad Application

* Choose a **real or fictional organization** (e.g., a school, hospital, bank, or online store).
* For this organization:

  1. Identify **one scenario each** where **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** might be compromised.

     * Example: Confidentiality breach could be a stolen student database.
  2. Write **one solution or control** to protect each principle of the CIA Triad.

     * Example: Encrypt the database to protect confidentiality.



#### Part 3: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks Mapping

* For the same organization, create a **table** with at least **3 examples** showing the difference between threats, vulnerabilities, and risks:

| **Threat**             | **Vulnerability**                         | **Risk**                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Phishing attack        | Staff are not trained to spot fake emails | Hackers steal sensitive data via phishing     |
| Ransomware             | No backup system in place                 | Operations stop, leading to data loss         |
| Insider misuse of data | Weak access control policies              | Employees leak sensitive customer information |



#### Deliverable

* A **2–3 page report** that includes:

  * Definition of cybersecurity in your own words.
  * CIA Triad scenarios and solutions.
  * A table differentiating threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.
